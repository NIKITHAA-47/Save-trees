        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
        Trees are the most valuable gift of nature to humankind. 
        They purify the air, provide food and shelter, prevent soil erosion, 
        and maintain the balance of our ecosystem. 
        In today's world, where deforestation is increasing rapidly, 
        it is our duty to understand the importance of trees and take steps to protect them. 
        Saving trees is not just about saving plants — it's about saving life on Earth.
        </p>
        <h2>Why trees are important?</h2>
        <p>Trees are the lungs of our planet. They produce oxygen,absorb carbon dioxide, and provide shelter for countless species. Without trees, life on Earth cannot survive. They also provide essential habitats and food for wild life, prevent soil errosion, regulate the water cycle, and offer materials for shelter, paper, medicine. Futhermore, trees improve air and water quality.</p>
        <h2>Main cause of deforestation:</h2>
        <p>Deforestation has just become practise in this modern era which can be quite hazardous if this continuous to go on for the future generation.</p>

        <h2>Effects of deforestation:</h2>
        <p>Deforestation has significant negative effects, including climate change due to increased greenhouse gases, loss of biodiversity and habitat destruction, soil erosion and distrupted water cycles leading to more floods and droughts.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
        <p>
            Trees are the true guardians of our planet. They give us clean air to breathe, 
        cool shade to rest, and balance the Earth's climate. Each tree we save today 
        is a step toward a greener, safer future for the next generation. 
        Let's promise to protect, plant, and care for trees — because when we save trees, 
        we save life on Earth.
